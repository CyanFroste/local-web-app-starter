# Local Web App Starter

An opinionated but extensible web app for local use.
The client has api bridges to work with file system, databases and system processes.
Also includes some nifty utilities such as a key value store, configurations, etc.

## Dev

Run the backend and client separately using `cargo run` and `pnpm dev` for backend and client respectively.

## Build

Run the scripts inside `scripts` to try out the release build which can be found inside `bin` after running the script.
